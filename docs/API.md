## Introduction
Shuffle is a platform to build and execute automation [workflows](/docs/workflows). It's built API-first, and everything available on the frontend has an API endpoint. The listed API's are built and generated with our own [OpenAPI creator](/docs/apps#create_openapi_app). All API's listed are for both versions of Shuffle (cloud/onprem), unless otherwise specified. Our OpenAPI specification can be [downloaded here](https://shuffler.io/apps/edaa73d40238ee60874a853dc3ccaa6f). Below are the base URL's for the API.

**Cloud:** https://shuffler.io/api/v1

**Onprem:** https://<endpoint>:<port>/api/v1

## Authentication
Shuffle uses [Bearer auth](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/) for authentication. This means that every request you send to the API, you need to send it with the header "Authorization: Bearer <APIKEY>". If Shuffle is multi-tenancy configured, you may have multiple organizations. If you want to specify the organization to use, you may add the header "Org-Id: <ORGID>". It will otherwise use the current active organization.

While logged in, you can go to https://shuffler.io/settings or /settings in your local instance to get your APIkey. Keep this safe. 

**Get all apps example**
```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**Authentication failure**
Status code: 401
```json
{"success": false}
```


## Responses
Shuffle responses follow the response codes listed below. The data you can expect is mostly in the following json form, whether success or failure.

```json
{
	"success": <true/false>,
	"reason": "You failed to do something"
}
```


| Code 	 | Description   |
| ------ | ------------- |
| 200    | Successful request. Usually contains information about the success. |
| 401    | Not authorized, or an error occurred. Usually contains a reason for the error. |
| 405    | Method not allowed. We use GET/POST/PUT/DELETE |
| 500    | A backend error occurred. |


## Workflow API
Workflows are used to execute your automations, and has endpoints related to creation, triggers, saving and deleting, aborting and listing.

### List all workflows
Return a list of all existing workflows. 

Disable truncating (since 2.0.2)**: Add the `truncate=false` header, and we will directly return the list without modifications IF it is less than 32Mb in size. 
We may otherwise truncate the data, and add the `X-SHUFFLE_TRUNCATED=true` response header if the data is sufficiently large.

Method: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```


### List workflow runs
Returns a list of executions for a given workflow. Use "top=10" to get 10 last results. Use "cursor=<cursor>" to get next page.

Method: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/executions -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**Success response**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "executions": [],
  "cursor": "cursor"
}
```

### List workflow executions (old)
Returns a list of executions for a given workflow

Method: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/executions -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**Success response**

```json
[]
```


### Get a workflow
Returns a given workflow. This is the same as exporting the workflow.

Method: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id} -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```


### Create new workflow
Creates a basic workflow with a given name and description. Returns a startpoint for a workflow. 

Method: POST

```bash
curl -XPOST https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"name": "Example API workflow", "description": "Description for the workflow"}'
```

**Success response**

```json
{"actions":[],"branches":[],"triggers":[],"schedules":null,"id":"25cb3cc6-f343-4511-827f-b60557043327","is_valid":true,"name":"Example API workflow","description":"Description for the workflow","start":"","owner":"4669463f-f98e-4d86-891d-76edac4356c6","sharing":"private","execution_org":{"name":"","org":"","users":null,"id":""},"workflow_variables":null}
```


### Save a workflow
Saves a workflow with a given WORKFLOW_ID. Requires WORKFLOW_ID from [Create new workflow](/docs/API#create_new_workflow) to match in the parameter and the data sent.

**PS: This function is destructive and does not check everything, but will return if there are missing apps or similar**

Method: PUT

```bash
curl -XPUT https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/WORKFLOW_ID -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" --data '{"actions":[],"branches":[],"triggers":[],"schedules":null,"id":"WORKFLOW_ID","is_valid":true,"name":"Example workflow","description":"Description for the workflow","start":"","owner":"4669463f-f98e-4d86-891d-76edac4356c6","sharing":"private","execution_org":{"name":"","org":"","users":null,"id":""},"workflow_variables":null}'
```

**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true}
```


### Delete a workflow
Deletes a workflow with a given ID.

Method: DELETE

```bash
curl -XDELETE https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/apcb3cc6-f343-4511-827f-b60557043327 -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" 
```

**Success response** 

```json
{"success": true}
```


### Execute workflow
Executes a given workflow with optional arguments "execution_argument" and "start". Start is an optional node to start from. [See Additional Optional Arguments](https://github.com/Shuffle/shuffle-shared/blob/57b211816d87b47acde1481084b187fda13d05ba/structs.go#L126).

Methods: POST, GET

```bash
curl -XPOST https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/execute -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{
	"execution_argument": "DATA TO EXECUTE WITH",
	"start": ""
}'
```

Additional info:
- If you don't send JSON to the API, but a random string, we will take the entire string as the execution argument.
- You can add dynamic app authentication when starting a workflow by using the following header: 'appauth'. Example: 'appauth: jira=auth for jira;elasticsearch=elasticsearch auth'. This works both with the name of the auth, and the ID.
- If you want to run the workflow with a different environment, use the "environment" header with the name. Example: 'environment: cloud'. The environment needs to be the name of an existing environment.

**Success response** 

```json
{"success": true, "execution_id": "6e58639e-a24f-4af8-b62b-d6fcc2bc10f4", "authorization": "26fb304f-92c9-4ca5-9735-9173ce80569e"}
```


### Get execution results
Gets an execution based on results from [Execute workflow](/docs/api#execute_workflow). Requires execution_id and authorization parameters. You can only use the authorization key in the data itself to get the ID, not in the header. To track progress, call this every few seconds and look for updates to "results" (json["results"]).

Methods: POST

```bash
curl -XPOST https://shuffler.io/api/v1/streams/results -d '{
	"execution_id": "ad9baac7-dc30-42da-bb1f-18b84309cfb7",
	"authorization": "62b3de56-9de0-4983-ad72-e63c42d123f8"
}'
```

**Success response** 

```json
{"type":"workflow","status":"ABORTED","start":"","execution_argument":"DATA TO EXECUTE WITH","execution_id":"ad9baac7-dc30-42da-bb1f-18b84309cfb7","workflow_id":"8f3c6a10-f5ca-432c-aef9-c5e038166c45","last_node":"","authorization":"62b3de56-9de0-4983-ad72-e63c42d123f8","result":"","started_at":1591074812,"completed_at":1591074857,"project_id":"shuffle","locations":["europe-west2"],"workflow":{"actions":[{"app_name":"testing","app_version":"1.0.0","app_id":"c567fc10-9c15-403e-b72c-6550e9e76bc8","errors":null,"id":"de10798e-2c66-4e0c-bfdd-8b645a8e3748","is_valid":true,"isStartNode":true,"sharing":true,"private_id":"","label":"testing_1","small_image":"","large_image":"","environment":"Shuffle","name":"repeat_back_to_me","parameters":[{"description":"message to repeat","id":"","name":"call","example":"","value":"232.21.10.12","multiline":true,"action_field":"","variant":"STATIC_VALUE","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}}],"position":{"x":-326.750381666118,"y":52.50022245682308},"priority":0},{"app_name":"Virustotal","app_version":"1.0.0","app_id":"e5d625cee91f5f8328f2f4ef09ef313e","errors":null,"id":"bdec0a1c-381c-4e90-ba04-db40db98406c","is_valid":true,"isStartNode":false,"sharing":false,"private_id":"e5d625cee91f5f8328f2f4ef09ef313e","label":"Virustotal_1","small_image":"","large_image":"","environment":"Shuffle","name":"get_ip_report","parameters":[{"description":"The apikey to use","id":"","name":"apikey","example":"","value":"","multiline":false,"action_field":"VT APIKEY","variant":"WORKFLOW_VARIABLE","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}},{"description":"Generated by shuffler.io OpenAPI","id":"","name":"ip","example":"","value":"128.0.0.11","multiline":false,"action_field":"","variant":"STATIC_VALUE","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}}],"position":{"x":-657.9998647811465,"y":52.000953074820615},"priority":0}],"branches":[{"destination_id":"bdec0a1c-381c-4e90-ba04-db40db98406c","id":"7ad84769-3e7f-48af-af73-802bc93b5c2c","source_id":"de10798e-2c66-4e0c-bfdd-8b645a8e3748","label":"","has_errors":false,"conditions":null}],"triggers":null,"schedules":null,"id":"8f3c6a10-f5ca-432c-aef9-c5e038166c45","is_valid":true,"name":"VT testing","description":"Helo","start":"de10798e-2c66-4e0c-bfdd-8b645a8e3748","owner":"4669463f-f98e-4d86-891d-76edac4356c6","sharing":"private","execution_org":{"name":"","org":"","users":null,"id":""},"workflow_variables":[{"description":"","id":"ec16e9a6-5d13-46ba-8613-ebf301569f44","name":"VT APIKEY","value":""}]},"results":null}
```


### Abort workflow

Aborts an execution based on a WORKFLOW_ID and EXECUTION_ID. Can only be done while the status is "EXECUTING".

Methods: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/executions/{execution_id}/abort -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**Success response** 

```json
{"success": true}
```

## Datastore API
Datastore is a persistent storage mechanism you can use for workflows to talk to each other between executions, or for normal storage. Below are the endpoints related to datastore (cache) creation, listing, deletion and more. This API is available to Python apps by using self.set_cache("key", "value") and self.get_cache("key")

### Add a key
To add a key to a specific category, add `"category": "name"` to the JSON body.

Methods: POST, PUT

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/orgs/{org_id}/set_cache -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"key":"hi", "value":"1234", "category": "category"}'
```


**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true}
```

### Add multiple keys
To add a key to a specific category, add `"category": "name"` to the JSON body. Only keys of the first discovered category will be added.

Methods: POST, PUT

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v2/datastore?bulk=true -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '[{"key":"hi", "value":"1234", "category": "category"}]'
```


**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true}
```


### Get a key
Search for a cache key. For keys set in a workflow, it may unavailable with the normal API, and require execution_id & authorization in the JSON body.

To get a key from a specific category, add `"category": "name"` to the JSON body.
 
Methods: POST

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/orgs/{org_id}/get_cache -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"org_id": "ORG_ID", "key": "hi"}'
```

```


### List all keys
List existing datastore (cache) keys. By default, this will include the 50 last modified keys from any category. 

To list keys from a specific category, ?category=<name> to the URL.

Available queries:
- top: default 50. How many keys to return.
- cursor: to get the next page
- category: the category to get

Methods: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/orgs/{org_id}/list_cache -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```


**Success response** 
```json
{"success":true,"keys":[{"success":false,"workflow_id":"99951014-f0b1-473d-a474-4dc9afecaa75","execution_id":"f0b2b4e9-90ca-4835-bdd4-2889ef5f926f","org_id":"2e7b6a08-b63b-4fc2-bd70-718091509db1","key":"hi","value":"1234"}]}
```

### Delete a key
Deletes a key, completely removing all references to it. 

To delete a key from a specific category, add `"category": "name"` to the JSON body.

Methods: DELETE

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/orgs/{org_id}/delete_cache  -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"org_id": "ORG_ID", "key": "hi"}'
```


**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true}
```


## App API
Apps are the building blocks used in [workflows](/docs/apps#workflows), as they contain the actions to be executed. First of all, there are two types of apps:

* Generated from OpenAPI
* Self-made with Python

Here's how to distinguish them for now:
* OpenAPI: app.activated & app.generated = true, and app.private_id length > 0
* Normal: Opposite of OpenAPI

### Get apps
Returns a list of existing apps that you have access to, including private ones.

Methods: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

### Delete an app 
Deletes an app if you have access to delete it.

Methods: DELETE

```bash
curl -XDELETE https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/{app_id} -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

### Upload a python app 
Uploads a python app. You should upload a zip file with the following like file structure. This has to be done for each individual version of the app. The app uploaded is available to everyone in the organization.

If you need help with this section, [look into the Shuffle CLI utility as well](https://github.com/Shuffle/shufflecli). 

To zip an app, go to the appfolder, e.g. shuffle-tools, then type in the following to zip the version you want to upload (\*nix):
```
zip app.zip -r version/*
```

This will give you the following structure.
``` 
app.zip
├── src
│   ├── app.py
├── api.yaml
├── Dockerfile
├── requirements.txt
```       

Methods: POST

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/upload -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -F 'shuffle_file=@./your_file/file_path/app.zip'
```
**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true, "id": "798f1234c4fb8b4a6300da3c546af45a"}
```

The ID returned is based on these fields being unique: 
- Organization
- App Name
- App ID

After an app is uploaded, the App cache for your Organization is cleared, meaning your apps will be loaded from the database directly. 
If you want to see whether your app was uploaded or not, you can always check the app directly here (swap appid): https://shuffler.io/apps/{appid}

## Stats and Timelines
Stats and Timelines are a system built to help track changes to something over time. This is used both by internal systems in Shuffle, and is an option for you to use in Workflows or elsewhere to make timelines. Adding statistics was added in versions >1.4.3, and graphing of ANY value will be available soon. Graphs for default tracked information like App and Workflow utilisation is on the [statistics admin page for your Organisation](https://shuffler.io/admin?admin_tab=billing). 

**PS: Statistics are visible to you for every 5th number counted. This means you need to count the number 1 five times, or any number higher than 5 one time for it to be visible.**

### Get Stats
Returns the statistics for an organisation

Method: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/orgs/{ORG_ID}/stats  -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**Success response**
```

      "value": 123,
      "daily_value": 113
    }
  ]
}
```

### Count Stats for Custom key 
Add a statistic to be added, e.g. for number of tickets found over time. Custom statistics are tracked under the key "custom_X", where "custom_" is appended unless supplied, and "X" is the key you supply. They can be found in the "additions" section of the Get Stats API response.

Use the "Count Stats" action in Shuffle tools to do this in a Workflow 

Method: POST

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/orgs/{ORG_ID}/stats  -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"key": "tickets", "value": 6}'
```

**Success response**
```json
{"success": true, "reason": "Cache incremented by 6"}
```

## App Authentication
App Authentication is a way to store authentication keys encrypted and safe, available through using their ID. You can interact with it through a workflow, an app or the admin panel at /admin?tab=app_auth. To use an authentication after it's made, it has to be mapped to an action in a workflow by it's ID.

Here is a brief video that you can watch to learn more about it:




[![App Authentication video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/LoDaAmHDhFg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoDaAmHDhFg)



	
### List App Authentication
Get a list of all app authentication. These are all the authentication currently available to YOUR organization. These can be distributed from Parent org to Child org.

Methods: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/authentication -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true, "data": []}
```

### Set Authentication Everywhere
When you have an authentication available, it is possible to set it everywhere using an API. This will update all your current workflows that uses that app to use the specified authentication. This can also be done while creating an app authentication by setting the field `"auto_distribute": true` in the json

Methods: POST

```bash
curl -XPOST https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/authentication/{authentication_id}/config -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"action"
: "assign_everywhere", "id": "authentication_id"}'
```

**Success response**
```json
{"success": true}
```

### Allow suborgs to use auth
Parent organizations have the option to allow child orgs to use the same auth. The suborgs can not modify the auth they get access to. Intended for use where you e.g. have one ticketing system as an MSSP which you want to create tickets in from your child orgs (customers).

Methods: POST

```bash
curl -XPOST https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/authentication/{authentication_id}/config -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"action"
: "suborg_distribute", "id": "authentication_id"}'
```

**Success response**
```json
{"success": true}
```

### Delete App Authentication
Delete an authentication. PS: This does NOT change the ID of every workflow that utilizes the app.

Methods: DELETE

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/authentication/{authentication_id} -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true}
```

### Add App Authentication
Add authentication to an app, available through e.g. the Workflow editor, or authentication explorer. When adding this, make sure the app has an ID (uuid) and name attached to it, and that the fields are matching the apps' description.

You can find the fields following these steps:
1. Get the app you want to use (e.g. Jira)
2. Find a sample Action (doesn't matter which)
3. Loop through the Action's parameter's and find fields tagged with `"configuration": true`

**If you want it auto distributed to all existing workflows in your org, add `"auto_distribute": true` to the JSON body**

Method: PUT

```bash
curl -XPUT https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/authentication -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" '{
	"label":"Auth for Jira",
	"app": {
		"name":"Jira",
		"id":"1836c9786bb54748bd8913c0617d50fd",
		"app_version":"1.0.0"
	}, "fields":[
		{"key":"username_basic","value":"asd"},
		{"key":"password_basic","value":"qwe"},
		{"key":"url","value":"https://api-url"}
	],
	"active":true
}'
```

**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true, "id": "app_id"}
```

### Search existing apps 
Returns a list of apps that are hidden in the backend, e.g. OpenAPI apps loaded from [Security API's](https://github.com/frikky/OpenAPI-security-definitions). Requires the search parameter. 

Example: {"search": "secure"} will match both "secureworks" and "Cisco openVuln", because Secureworks has "secure" in its name and Cisco uses "secure" in its description.

Methods: POST

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/search -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{"search": "APPNAME"}'
```

**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true, "reason": [{apps here}]}
```

```

### Delete a file
Deletes a file. The file meta is left intact, but the file itself is removed from existence. Status is changed to "deleted".

**PS: To REMOVE the data entirely, add `?remove_metadata=true` to the url** 

Methods: DELETE

```bash
curl -XDELETE https://shuffler.io/api/v1/files/{id} -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" 
```


**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true}
```

### Edit an existing file
Edit an active file with existing content (/upload) for first uploads. The file meta is left intact, except for the hash sums, sizing and timestamps. This function is meant to be used together with [file categories](#get_file_category) to e.g. handle Detection rules.

Methods: PUT

```bash
curl -XPUT https://shuffler.io/api/v1/files/{id}/edit -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d 'this is the new content of the file'
```


**Success response** 
```json
{"success": true}
```

### Get file category
Gets all files in a namespace zipped. The point of this function is to be able to load in multiple files at once in order to e.g. run detections. By adding the query ids=true, it will instead give you a list of all the files. When receiveing file it will automatically deduplicate files with the same Sha256 hash.

Methods: GET

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/files/namespaces/{category} -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```

**?id=true**
```json
{"success": True, "list": [{
	"name": "Filename",
	"id": "file_uuid",
},
{
	"name": "Filename2",
	"id": "file_uuid2",

## Integration Layer
The Integration Layer of Shuffle is a way to interact with apps a new way. It utilizes Apps that are Categorized and Labeled, and gives access to API's for specific actions for each of those labels. Behind the scenes there is always a workflow for each of these, and Shuffle wants to give granular control of each individual Workflow if wanted. The integration layer is based on [Shuffle's Schemaless translation technology](https://github.com/frikky/schemaless), built on top of LLMs, with the goal of making Shuffle be able to act as a Large **Action** Model (LAM).

<img width="713" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Shuffle/Shuffle-docs/assets/5719530/e806707d-9635-465b-8040-b3e26b1786a0">

### Shufflepy
The easiest way to try it out for developer is to [use the Shufflepy library](https://github.com/frikky/schemaless). 

```python
from shufflepy import Shuffle

## If the url is not specified, the library will use `https://shuffler.io` as the default URL. You must specify an apikey. 

shuffle = Singul("APIKEY")
resp = shuffle.list_tickets("jira")
```
		
### Run a Category Action
Runs the category action in a standardized format.
	
Methods: POST 

```bash
curl -XPOST https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/categories/run -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY" -d '{
	"app_name": "PagerDuty",
	"category": "cases",
	"label": "create_ticket",
	"fields": [{
		"key": "title",
		"value": "This is the title"
	}, {
		"key": "description",
		"value": "This is the description"
	}, {
		"key": "source",
		"value": "Shuffle"
	}],
	"skip_workflow": true
}'
```

**Success response** 
**200** means the app ran and performed both input and output translation properly
```json
Default Label Output
```

**202** means the app ran, but the output translation failed. This will return the DEFAULT output of the action that ran.

**Other status codes**: They are based on the API from the app itself, and indicates something went wrong.

### Get Active Categories
To find what categories with what apps you have that are active, run this API. It will return with what categories and actions for those categories you have available. This is based on the current organization.
	
Methods: GET 

```bash
curl https://shuffler.io/api/v1/apps/categories -H "Authorization: Bearer APIKEY"
```


**Success response** 
```json
[{
	"name":"Cases",
	"color":"",
	"icon":"cases",
	"action_labels":["Create ticket"],
	"app_labels": [{
		"app_name":"PagerDuty",
		"large_image":"",
		"id":"50af6d9f18134b90aabca9180b37ea01",
		"labels": [{
			"category":"Cases",
			"label":"Create ticket"
		}]
	}]
}]
```


### How to debug Singul executions
- Go to https://shuffler.io/workflows/debug
- You should see something like this:


<img src="https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/singul-debugger.png?raw=true"> 


As you can see, I triggered this Singul execution through the Singul app (not the SDK). However, even if you were using the SDK, you would find such executions.

- Click on the icon below "Explore":

<img src="https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/explore-singul.png?raw=true">

- You will see the full result of the execution. Click on the arrow

<img src="https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/singul-debugging-step1.png?raw=true">

- To see the body that Singul translated to, scroll and find the "Body" 

<img src="https://github.com/frikky/shuffle-docs/blob/master/assets/singul-debugging-step2.png?raw=true">


Based on the output, and the input mentioned in "Body", you should be able to figure out what is going on here.
