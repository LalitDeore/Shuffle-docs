## Shuffle Cloud

### About the Shuffle Cloud plan
The Shuffle Cloud plan is made for anyone that wants to use Shuffle as a Service (SaaS), without worrying about infrastructure or scalability. The Cloud plan includes, but is not limited to access to Multi-Tenancy, Multi-Region and an unlimited amount of Workflows, Users, Apps and Organizations, Workflows as Functions and more. Features such as Multi-Environments and running Workflows and their Actions on-premises are also available. Additional features added over time, will be made immediately available to the User as it is released to their specific region.

The pricing structure is based on the amount of App Runs completed per month. The Shuffle team will spend time with you at the start of the contract to make sure we can fully support your Apps and API’s, and will be available for followup sessions to help with your automation needs, and provide a point of contact within Shuffle.

An App Run is based on how many Apps are executed within a Workflow. Actions within sub-organizations will count towards the same total as your main organization. The amount of App Runs included are refreshed on a monthly basis, and are renewed on the first of every month. The first billing cycle will start on the first of the next month, with the User getting immediate access from the day of payment.

If User's usage exceeds the initial (as set forth above) or subsequently increased Included App Run limit ("Excess Usage"), Shuffle will automatically enable and invoice fees for Excess Usage at the rate specified in Service Details per App Run for the month of Excess Usage provided that User will have fourteen (14) days after first exceeding its Included Usage limit to contact Shuffle and request to increase its Included Usage limit to cover its Excess Usage to such date and any future usage.

## Shuffle OnPrem (Self-Host)

### About the Shuffle OnPrem (Self-Host) plan
The Shuffle OnPrem (Self-Host) plan is made for anyone that wants to operate Shuffle within their own environment, with the option to scale out easily. It includes an upgraded license for the “Orborus” and “Worker” system, and includes regular support to help with uptime and maintenance of your Shuffle systems. The Shuffle team will spend time with you at the start of our contract to get your supported instance up and running, and provide a point of contact within Shuffle. This plan is aimed at growing together, and uses scalable pricing.

If the User has more throughput than what their paid infrastructure can handle, Shuffle can not and will not guarantee high availability of Shuffle and its services, unless more computational resources are made available. In the case Shuffle has helped scope and decide the amount of computational resources necessary to handle the amount of throughput, but these are underestimated or further scale is required because of the underestimation, this does not lead to further costs on the side of the User until contract renegotiations.

The pricing structure is based on the amount of App Runs completed per month. The Shuffle team will spend time with you at the start of the contract to make sure we can fully support your Apps and API’s, and will be available for followup sessions to help with your automation needs, and provide a point of contact within Shuffle.

An App Run is based on how many Apps are executed within a Workflow. Actions within sub-organizations will count towards the same total as your main organization. The amount of App Runs included are refreshed on a monthly basis, and are renewed on the first of every month. The first billing cycle will start on the first of the next month, with the User getting immediate access from the day of payment.

If User's usage exceeds the initial (as set forth above) or subsequently increased Included App Run limit ("Excess Usage"), Shuffle will automatically enable and invoice fees for Excess Usage at the rate specified in Service Details per App Run for the month of Excess Usage provided that User will have fourteen (14) days after first exceeding its Included Usage limit to contact Shuffle and request to increase its Included Usage limit to cover its Excess Usage to such date and any future usage.

## Hybrid Cloud Access

### About Hybrid Cloud Access
Shuffle Cloud access is a part of Shuffle On-Prem, and gives the User access to features which aren’t feasible without the cloud integrations. This includes such features as Cloud Triggers, Configuration backups, workflow recommendations, a search engine. It will further be extended by new features as they become available, such as notifications and platform recommendations, New Triggers, App, playbook downloads, a cloud search engine and more. Hybrid Cloud can be enabled by following the Organization management documentation found here: https://shuffler.io/docs/organizations.

All future features that are made for our Software-As-A-Service offering will be made accessible from the day they are implemented. All limits are soft limits which can be seen for each individual Organization in their Admin dashboard. Default limits include 2000 app executions, 1000 emails and 300 SMS for free each month, with the addition of multi-tenant cloud environments to enable hybrid for each on-premises organization. If the limits are exceeded over multiple periods (>=2 months), Shuffle may stop access to either of these features after notifying the User.

## Support

### About Support
Support will be provided by our experienced team of security engineers. Support is purchased separate from the license, but can be bundled together for a lower cost agreed upon by Shuffle and the User.

Shuffle’s support team will provide support via remote assistance. All requests will be performed via email or our support portal (as it becomes available). Critical events can be logged via alert email under the Enterprise Support Plan and can be performed by online meetings (onCall).

Our initial response (or acknowledgement) time for critical issues like service downtime is as follows:

| Sr. No. | Event    | Description | Support Level | Time  |
|---------|----------|------------|--------|---------|
| 1       | Normal   | Trouble or any conditions where Shuffle is not fully functional, but is not causing business impact to the User. | Standard Support | 24 Hours |
| 2       | Critical |  Trouble conditions where Shuffle is completely out of service or not fully functional, and is causing business impact to the User. | Enterprise Support | 15 Minutes |

Any normal support requests should be sent to the Shuffle support email which is support@shuffler.io, while critical support requests should be directed to the alert email provided to the User during the onboarding process. Further details on Support are as follows:

| Name | Standard Support | Enterprise Support |
|------|------------------|--------------------|
| Email Support | Yes | Yes |
| onCall Support | No | Yes |
| Alert Mechanism | No | Yes |
| Professional Services | No | Yes |
| Support Hours | 09:00AM - 3:00PM EST | 09:00AM - 3:00PM EST; 12:00PM - 5:00PM CEST; 10:00AM - 6:00PM IST
| Support Days | Mon-Fri | Moni-Fri; Everyday for Alerts with slower response time on weekends |

Abuse of the critical event email will force blocking of further use in the future.


### About Standard Support

Standard Support is email-based, and includes expert guidance and / or support with upgrades, solution configuration, deployment and bug fixes. It further includes help with deployment during onboarding and maintenance.

### About Enterprise Support

Enterprise support covers everything under Standard Support, and
- On top of email-based support, it includes online meetings (onCall).
- It include "alert" mechanism. Shuffle will provide an alert email to the User for critical issues that require urgent attention and cannot wait for the standard 24 hours response window.
- Beyond the topics covered by Standard Support, Enterprise Support includes Professional Services that cover custom features, integrations or apps, or work specific to the User, as agreed upon by Shuffle and the User.

### About Alert Mechanism

Shuffle's alert mechanism is essentially for an expedited response from the Shuffle team. It brings the response time down from 24 hours to 15 minutes. It should be used when Shuffle is completely out of service or not fully functional, and is causing business impact to the User. Absue of this mechanism will force blocking of further use in the future for the User.

### About Professional Services

Professional Service gives User access to Non-recurring engineering (NRE), advice and process improvement by the experienced Shuffle team. NRE is any special development required by the User that is not covered by Standard Support and includes, but not limited to, new Integrations or Apps, Workflow development and special development of the Shuffle platform itself. Advice and process improvements are part of our professional services goal to help operations teams work more effectively, and in a more standardized manner.

#### Custom Shuffle App Development
Custom App Development in Shuffle incurs when the User requires an integration or extension which Shuffle doesn’t already have a developed version of. Shuffle will develop the necessary functions of the App, as well as any Action the User sees necessary for future use-cases. This process is typically started based on a use-case, where Shuffle will help identify the needs of the User. If this is not proprietary software, Shuffle will share the use-cases with the community to further support the community, and if agreed upon, Shuffle will add information about the User as the sponsor and/or co-creator of the App, without the entitlement of any compensation.

#### Custom Workflow Development
Custom Workflow Development in Shuffle incurs when the User requires a process to be automated with the help of Shuffle automation experts. Workflow development will start with a conversation between Shuffle and User to define our goals, before User gives access to a demo environment of the required tools if applicable. If this is not proprietary software or processes, Shuffle will share the use-cases with the community to further support the community, and if agreed upon, Shuffle will add information about the User as the sponsor and/or co-creator of the App, without the entitlement of any compensation.

#### Special Shuffle Platform Development
Special Shuffle Platform Development in Shuffle incurs when the User requires a change, update, or build of Shuffle platform itself. Special Shuffle platform development will start with a conversation between Shuffle and User to define our goals, before User gives access to a demo environment of the required tools if applicable.


#### Custom Miscellaneous Development
Custom Miscellaneous Development is incurred when the User requires help or development related to, but not limited to, infrastructure, in-product development, dashboards, or any other miscellaneous work. While not directly associated with Shuffle, the User can discuss the scope of the work, and necessary help can be provided if both Shuffle and the User agree to the scope of the work.



## Disaster recovery & Business continuity
Shuffle’s cloud services run completely on GCP and use GCP serverless functionality all around the world as redundant systems to ensure that User can reliably access their active utilities. In the case of problems with an onPrem (self-hosted) version of Shuffle, the User can work with Shuffle Support to provide the services necessary to get their instance up and running at full capacity.

In the case of complete failures with GCP, it is likely to be resolved in a number of hours, but the service failure also translates to a complete failure of GCP. This would mean that other services running on GCP have also failed too. If a User strongly desires to get access to certain information during the outage, the User's IT team can work with Shuffle Support to access the required information. This may require extra verification of the person asking, as to verify whether they work with the User or not.

Once GCP and Shuffle come back online, Shuffle will work with the User to ensure any and all use-cases affected by the outage will be running again at full capacity. If Shuffle on GCP is completely offline for an extended period of time (2+ days), Shuffle will work with the User to figure out a contingency plan to ensure the environment works as expected.

In the case of circumstances outside of Shuffle’s control such as sickness or deaths, preventing business continuity for the contract to be fulfilled by Shuffle directly, Shuffle’s partner, Infopercept will take over all operations for the Partner. Infopercept has certain access rights, allowing them to take over and host the Shuffle cloud platform by themselves under these circumstances, and have certain extra access due to support fulfillment.

## Availability
The System, Cloud Services, and related services shall be available at least 99.9% of the time, excluding scheduled downtime for routine maintenance (not to exceed 4 hours a month) and downtime attributable to Force Majeure (the “Availability SLA”). Compliance with the Availability SLA will be measured on a calendar month basis. For clarity, the system and cloud services here include workflow executions (backend) and shuffler.io site (frontend), which will be covered by the Availability SLA.

The Availability will be calculated by: (a) dividing: (i) the total number of minutes of up time (i.e., in which there were no Outages) during an applicable calendar month (excluding only downtime occurring during the scheduled maintenance period of 4 hours or less or attributable to elements of Force Majeure) by (ii) the total number of actual minutes in such month minus minutes of downtime occurring during the scheduled maintenance period or attributable to elements of Force Majeure, and then (b) multiplying that amount by 100.

For purposes of this Agreement, an “Outage” means that substantially all of the System and/or Cloud Services are dysfunctional or unavailable, and “Force Majeure” means events and conditions caused by acts of war, terrorism, hurricanes, earthquakes, other acts of God or of nature, strikes or other labor disputes, riots or other acts of civil disorder, embargoes, or other causes beyond the performing party’s reasonable control.


Credits will be provided as an addition to existing license tier provisioned to the User at no cost. The following Service Credits shall apply in the event the Availability SLA is not met:

| Less Than | Greater Than | Credit |
|------|------------------|--------------------|
| 99.9 | 99.8 | Additional 15k App Runs for 1 Month |
| 99.8 | 99.7 | Additional 30k App Runs for 2 Months |
| 99.7 | 99.6 | Additional 45k App Runs for 3 Months |
| 99.6 | 99.5 | Additional 60k App Runs for 4 Months |
| 99.5 | N/A | Additional 100k App Runs for 6 Months |

## Acceptable Use Policy
Our acceptable use policy sets per-organization usage limits and was designed to prevent misuse and unduly burdensome use of the platform. These limits are put in place for our cloud offering, and do not apply to the [open source model](https://github.com/frikky/shuffle), which is free indefinitely.

### Monthly limits for Cloud Services
All monthly limits are per organization, including its sub-organizations. 

### Starter Plan
- **App Executions** - 2000
- **Bandwidth** - 10GB in and 10GB out of Shuffle 

### Scale and Enterprise Plan

VENDOR’S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY CUSTOMER TO SHUFFLE IN A PERIOD OF TWELVE MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH CUSTOMER PRESENTS A CLAIM TO SHUFFLE WITH RESPECT TO SHUFFLE’S BREACH OF SHUFFLE’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

## Term and Termination

1. Term. The term of this Agreement (the “Term”) shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for the initial term selected by the Customer in the online registration process or as specified in a Customer Order, if any. Following its expiration, the Term will renew for successive terms equal to the initial term specified in the Customer Order, unless either party refuses such renewal by written notice to the other party 30 or more days before the renewal date. In the event the agreed requirements for the software are unfulfilled by Shuffle, the Customer may terminate this agreement and payment obligations, not without paying for any services already provided. Following the initial term, the Customer may terminate this Agreement by giving not less than sixty (60) days' prior written notice to terminate this Agreement.

Either party may terminate this Agreement or any Customer Order if the other party: (i) fails to cure any material breach (including, without limitation, Customer's failure to pay the Fees) of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after written notice of such breach; (ii) ceases operation without a successor; or (iii) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors arrangement, composition or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against such party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).

3. Effects of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, Shuffle shall discontinue Customer’s access to the System and Customer shall cease all use of the System and delete, destroy, or return all copies of the Documentation in its possession or control.
