# Easy Scaling, Multi-tenant Workflows and a slick new look

Shuffle 2.0 is *finally* here. It is a big step up, and has been in the works for 8+ months now. We are introducing a wholly new design, Multi-Tenant workflows, Open Sourcing the scalable worker, optimizing developer experience (DX), observability helpers, a look into the silly AI hype, and much much more. This post intends to cover the large topics in detail, with a small story of where why the problem existed in the first place. 

## Throwback

Shuffle is a fully bootstrapped company, and we will therefore keep growing at the pace of our revenue. We had a great growth year in 2024, going from a small internal team with only two full-time platform developers to the seven we have now, along with a larger team working in operations to handle finance, community and customer requests. And there seems to be nothing slowing us down now. We now have most of the features we want the Shuffle platform itself to have, and from here on, workflow generation and iterating on the user experience is core. 

And with the introduction of those features is where things started going wrong. To those unfamiliar; we initially released Shuffle 2.0 back at the start of December with the first release candidate, with most things that could have gone wrong, going wrong. Our team has grown faster than our processes were able to handle \- which is quite normal \- but doesn’t excuse our lack of quality as compared to where we were. So that is what we have been doing for the last two months. Polishing the 2.0 release. Fixing [everything we promised](https://shuffler.io/docs/about).  

Familiar, but new  
Shuffle’s design is quite simple: Dark background with orange. That has been core since the start. While updating and adding features to Shuffle, we have kept improving upon it, but never quite made a full overhaul. We never had the actual need to. Until now.

The new design in Shuffle now follows general standards (with a Shuffle flare), outlined by UI and UX experts, and we have hired a fulltime designer to be in charge of it. The role has included testing and implementing UI features, but the most important part is to improve the general usability and experience of the platform as a whole. The updated pages so far are all the primary product pages, where work within the Shuffle platform is being done: 

- App & new API testing pages  
- Workflow pages  
- Admin pages  
- Header / Left Sidebar  
- Usecases, Workflow merging & Validation systems

The goal of the update has been to improve both the manual workflow development AND to improve how discovery of workflows and apps within the platform is done. In addition to the general design update, there are quite a few quality of life updates within the Workflow development UI, with more to come. Some highlights:

- You no longer need to use the “hidden” tab to find Triggers.   
- We have highlighted some commonly used actions within Shuffle Tools  
- Runtime Location (previously Environments) are controlled on a workflow-wide level  
- You can swap to multi-tenant workflows with a single click  
- The code editor now feels a lot more like a code editor, with python in Shuffle being VERY close to normally written python (finally\!).   
- AI support to help within many different areas:  
  - Helps build out new nodes and fill in fields  
  - Helps test the actions if and when they fail  
  - Can support writing code and bodies within the code editor  
  - And a lot more AI-native features are coming, now that the 2.0 release is finally out.   
- Apps and their functions are testable without running them through Shuffle, using the new [SDK testing systems](https://github.com/shuffle/app_sdk).

To help support and test these new features, there are also new test and health systems in place which will help make the whole platform more robust. You may even see health workflows run in the background at times to test your instance.

## The Multi-Tenant workflow problem

Back when Shuffle was initially built in 2019, the goal was simple: Make it possible to move data from one data source to another, in the easiest way possible, with the process being editable. This idea is what we are still building upon, and Multi-Tenant workflows is one of our initial solutions to the problem. 

Multi-Tenant Workflows were implemented to make it possible for a single organization to have one workflow, but which works for as many customers as they want. We had many different approaches, including new authentication systems and subflow control mechanisms. But we landed on what is most likely the most elegant: 

Replicating the workflow itself in your Sub Organizations (tenants).

**But with that, many questions show up, such as:**

- What if you edit the parent? Do we just “copy” the workflow?  
- What if a trigger should work in a child workflow, but not the parent?  
- What if a SINGLE value in the child should be different?  
- What if the tools you are connecting to from one client are not the same as in another?  
- What about error notifications? Does the parent organization receive them?  
- What if a Subflow you use doesn’t exist?  
- Or authentication?  
- Or runtime location?  
- Or file? Or a datastore entry?  
- Or what if you want to search through ALL previous workflows in ALL suborgs to discover anything that may have gone wrong for observability?

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c81d5cb-cf72-4897-be9c-611e4ab4b7af)

As you can see: there were many areas to take care of. And they are solved. Most features in Shuffle are now multi-tenant, and can be distributed by clicking the “Distribution” button on the relevant item from the admin panel. This button may show up while you build a workflow in a parent org as well, as to help you. 

And there is more; every single change is tracked both in the parent workflow, as well as in the sub-organizations workflow. By doing so, and comparing old versus new versions of the parent workflow, it makes it so that you can make a change in the workflow of the sub-organization, which will stay intact even if you make a change in the parent organization. Which means:

- Want a different authentication? No problem.  
- Want a different app? No problem.  
- Want a webhook or subflow to be configured differently? No problem..  
- Want to change the conditions of a branch for a single customer?  
  Or to track changes made by a customer to one of the distributed workflows?   
  Or to run in a different runtime location (Orborus)? No problem..\!  
- And much much more.

This makes Shuffle THE most powerful no-code automation engine available. For anyone who has dealt with the problem of 10+ tenants having to be manually controlled, you know how exhausting this can be. But no more. And I want to thank our community of beta testers and customers who went through the testing of this with us \- we are forever grateful.

You can try the system for yourself by going to any workflow, opening the

## Observability and Validation mechanisms

The hardest part of building a platform like Shuffle is understanding the data. With 100+ new companies trying our cloud platform every week, we constantly get a clearer view as to what everyone is using Shuffle for. With this anonymously collected data, we have been able to optimize the most used apps and their authentication, understand what public Usecases or Workflows are and aren’t working, and from our learnings in these areas, build a general validation system. This has further turned into a larger focus on general observability. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9698aee-199f-4ef5-ae47-88c6f751b80e)

Shuffle is at its core an infrastructure platform. It runs in the background and runs code for you, just like your cloud provider is doing, while allowing you to be in control of everything along the way. Because of this, tracking what is happening is paramount, which leads to a requirements of three different areas of observability being required:

1. **Realtime**: Error alerting when an issue occurs (Notifications)  
2. **Retroactive**: Search back in time for anything that could have gone wrong (Runtime Debugger)  
3. **Current**: The state of a workflow, app, locations or authentication at the current moment

Since 1.4.0 we have been able to partially provide **\#1** and **\#2**, with them now having become finalized and multi-tenant. We have now additionally added a state to every workflow, which runs in the background at the end of every execution. Validation is based on the same checks we make for Notifications, but are kept as a state, both for the actual execution, as well as the workflow. If a workflow has finished with a problem, you should be able to see it. The error notification icon is now available in many areas, so please check it out if it shows up. Notifications are how you can make your workflows stable.

## Forms and Publishing

Since the start, we have allowed our users to publish their workflows and apps. The goal has been to find an incentive model for our users to be building and sharing their workflows, which is slowly coming to fruition with our [creator](http://shuffler.io/creators) and [partner](https://shuffler.io/partners) programs. We currently allow sharing of Apps and Workflows, with a few new additions coming VERY soon. 

**Remember**: Our mission at Shuffle is to make the security industry better at sharing, as to prevent more companies from getting hacked. And that doesn’t just mean processes with workflows. It means any data you may want to or be willing to share that could be useful to someone else. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/295df6b7-e94f-404b-aa1c-b5b4455956a3)

A brief overview of where this is going:

- [x] **Workflow** Sharing & Publishing  
- [x] **Python App** Sharing & Publishing  
- [x] **OpenAPI App** Sharing & Publishing  
- [x] Download & **usage tracking**, as to know who is using or forking what  
- [x] Public **Forms**: Making it possible for others to use your internal forms without logging in  
- [ ] File category Sharing, e.g. for Security rules like Sigma or Yara  
- [ ] Datastore category Sharing, e.g. for IOC or Alert sharing  
- [ ] Publishing Webhooks (Backend API sharing)  
- [ ] Creating controls for File Categories, Datastore Categories and Webhooks  
- [ ] Adding granular access controls for all these categories for existing Shuffle accounts  
- [ ] Making it possible to subscribe to changes, so that your workflow/app/files/datastore entries automatically update according to the original  

As you can see, there is one area that is new: Forms. As with Observability, there are also three steps any Automation platform needs for both technical and non-technical users to be able to be productive with it:

1. **Workflows**: The actual that runs automation  
2. **Datastore / File storage**: Permanent storage of information  
3. **A non-technical way to use Workflows**: Forms

Internally, we had the debate of what a frontend for Workflows would look like, and landed on a simple form system. The reason this came up is due to how the upgraded version of the “User Input” trigger works, which required a new page that could be published, which we eventually made into fully customizable forms. But what are forms? How can they be used? Here is a breakdown of what forms are:

- They are workflows, and any workflow has a form page. If the ID for a workflow is “123” and you usually go to the page **/workflows/123**, then the form page is **/forms/123**.   
- You can control the UI in the form of Markdown  
- You can control questions that require answering, including multiple-choice  
- You can control the output nodes from the workflow that the user will see. The output from the last node is also in Markdown, meaning you can show them whatever you want.   
- You should be able to use them without being forced to be logged in.   
- You should be able to quickswap to other forms from the same organization. 

But why do they exist? What was the reason we even came to the conclusion of needing them? Everyone in a security team wants a customizable toolbox. And not everyone will want to learn how to control automation themselves. Now you can provide the tools you want for your team to do their job better. 

## Scaling for everyone

Every automation platform goes through the problem of scaling. This is a simple fact of running infrastructure and someone else’s code. Shuffle also hit upon this problem within its first few months. We started out by building Shuffle to “just work”, as you should when building a product for the masses. What it turned into was a product with scaling problems, which were mostly solved in 2021\. 

So why was there a problem? It’s quite straightforward: Shuffle runs containerized. And we used containers badly. We initially deployed a new container for every single node in a workflow. And new containers have “cold start” CPU problems. This ended up working quite well with small workflows running rarely, where you wanted as much debugging information as possible. But it didn’t work quite as well when running large workflows with burst traffic, maybe containing some subflows. So we had to find a solution. And boy, did we. 

We initially built out a new scaling system back in 2021 based on the same architecture:

- Backend \-\> Orborus \-\> Worker \-\> Apps

But there is a key difference: The Workers and Apps only deploy **once**, instead of for each node. And they can scale across multiple servers. And you can add more servers without downtime. How? Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. 

But why didn’t we originally do this? Because it’s more complex, both to build and maintain.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8657373d-e9e3-4b25-a938-52b59c8b2245)

So today we are announcing that the scale version of Shuffle is officially publicly available\! This means that your high-availability setup where workflows run dreamily fast, is possible, whether you are a customer of Shuffle or not\! You can read about the setup of it here [in our Scaling documentation](https://shuffler.io/docs/configuration#scaling-shuffle).

But why didn’t we release it earlier? Also quite straightforward: We needed a way to earn money. And we thought licensing scale was the way to do it. But what we quickly realized was that what our customers are actually paying for is not a license. They are paying for the support of the platform itself, seeing as it quickly becomes mission critical infrastructure. Because of this, we are not worried about losing customers due to this, and have been as transparent as possible about it. Every one of you are now able to run workflows both in Verbose mode AND in Scale mode. It’s your choice. You can find out how this works on the new Admin panel for Runtime Locations (old Environments)\!  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2164c9b2-eac9-444b-a991-bb35b658d49d)

But what’s the catch? There really isn’t one. We have grown a tremendous amount, both on our cloud (SaaS) and with the open source (self-hosted) customer base, which has led to this point. And we want to keep providing the best automation software we can. And making more and more of what we do publicly available, instead of locking things down more and more as the trend seems to be.
